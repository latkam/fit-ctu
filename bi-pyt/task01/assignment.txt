# Homework 01 - Game of life
# 
# Your task is to implement part of the cell automata called
# Game of life. The automata is a 2D simulation where each cell
# on the grid is either dead or alive.
# 
# State of each cell is updated in every iteration based state of neighbouring cells.
# Cell neighbours are cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
#
# Rules for update are as follows:
# 
# 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
#
# 
# Our implementation will use coordinate system will use grid coordinates starting from (0, 0) - upper left corner.
# The first coordinate is row and second is column.
# 
# Do not use wrap around (toroid) when reaching edge of the board.
#

# Neighbours:
# 218
# 3X7
# 456

# Coordinates of neighbours:
# X->  x  |  y
# 1-> x-1 |  y
# 2-> x-1 | y-1
# 3->  x  | y-1
# 4-> x+1 | y-1
# 5-> x+1 |  y
# 6-> x+1 | y+1
# 7->  x  | y+1
# 8-> x-1 | y+1

# Implementation notes:
#  - all_cells are represented as a set
#  - valid_alive_cells are represented as a list
