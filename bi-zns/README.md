The aim of this subject was to explore different types of knowledge systems. The [OrodaelTurrim](https://github.com/Wilson194/OrodaelTurrim) framework forming a base of the knowledge system was used. Students were required to create knowledge base, infrence mechanism and action base for each type of the knowledge system.

## Tasks results
- task01 - Basic knowledge base and inference mechanism: **10/10** points
- task02 - Uncertainty: **10/10** points
- task03 - Fuzzy-logical inference: **14/15** points
