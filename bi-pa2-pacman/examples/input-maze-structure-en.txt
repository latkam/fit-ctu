This file defines input maze structure.

Definition of tile values:
    WALL_CORNER      = '+',
    WALL_HORIZONTAL  = '-',
    WALL_VERTICAL    = '|',
    DOOR             = '=',
    PACMAN           = 'C',
    BLINKY_FRGHTENED = 'B',
    PINKY_FRGHTENED  = 'P',
    INKY_FRGHTENED   = 'I',
    CLYDE_FRGHTENED  = 'L',
    BLINKY           = 'b',
    PINKY            = 'p',
    INKY             = 'i',
    CLYDE            = 'c',
    FRESH            = ' ',
    DOT              = '.',
    BONUS            = 'o',
    CHERRY           = '%',
    TELEPORT         = 'T'
    
In the input maze, following characters may occur:
'+', '-', '|', '.', ' ', 'o', 'C', 'T', '=', 'b', 'p', 'i', 'c', '%', '\n' (UNIX newline).        
Corners of the maze must consist of '+'.    
Horizontal walls must consist of '|'.
Vertical walls must consist of '-'.
No other character can occur on maze borders.
Number of teleports must be the same as defined in NConfig.hpp. The default value is 2.
There must be one tile with PACMAN.
There must be one tile with BLINKY. This ghost must be defined first among all ghosts.
There must be one tile with each of the following: PINKY, INKY, CLYDE in any order.
Tiles with PINKY, INKY and CLYDE are considered as their homes. Thus, one tile above
each of theese three ghosts, there must be DOOR. Over the door, there must be PACMAN,
FRESH, DOT, BONUS or CHERRY.
CHERRY must be set once in the maze.
Under the maze there must be game difficulty defined as follows: game difficulty {easy/medium/hard}.
Under the game difficulty definition, there must be ghost difficulty defined as follows: ghost difficuly {easy/medium/hard}.
Difficulty definitions are not case sensitive.

If any of the rules is violated, the input fails.
